# Algorithm-Simulation
## 1. Requirement
### Functional requirement:
-	Display function clearly(Button, slider bar,...)
-	Font size is enough to customer can see easily
-	The color of the blocks are suitable for algorithms
-	Smooth animation
-	When algorithm is finishing, must have message (end) for users.
### Non-Functional requirement:
- Response time : short
- Performance: good
- Graphic user interface: easy to use, the color of the blocks displayed matches the content
